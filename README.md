# Twitter Streaming API Example

Please don't share my api keys :)

To use:

1. Clone the repo and run `npm install`
2. Make sure you have `babel-node` installed (run `npm install -g babel-cli`)
3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys stored inside (find example file in `.env.example`)
4. Run the script with `babel-node index.js`
